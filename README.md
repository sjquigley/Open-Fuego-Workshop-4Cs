## Workshop Goals

***Learn...***

* best practices for working with code in the classroom.

* how to use a code editor to work with code.

* how to build repositories and host sites using GitHub.

* how to find resources and support to sustain your learning. <p>&nbsp;</p>


## Proceedings 

* [What is Open Fuego?](https://sjquigley.github.io/Open-Fuego-Presentation/) - Software design and pedagogical goals.

* [Where do I find it?](https://open-fuego.github.io/Open-Fuego-Coding-Tools/) - Tool descriptions, demos, and links to GitHub repositories.

* [I am...a project in becoming ](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/I-am-a-project-in-becoming)- Build your own webtext with this introductory tool.

* [Open Fuego Webtext Generator](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/open-fuego-webtext-generator)- Preview this code-based webtext generator. 

* [Workshop Feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffIR6Cml15Gz_4Enxp39Pq3ynN9ivYxCeZTf3J5Q8e9NZsWg/viewform?usp=sf_link) - I'd love to learn a little about how that went. <p>&nbsp;</p>


## Additional Resources
- [Best Practices for Collaborating on GitHub](https://github.com/sjquigley/GitHub-in-the-Tech-Comm-Classroom) Tools/strategies for teaching collaboration on GitHub. 
- [W3](https://www.w3schools.com) Provides a wide range of code reference, tutorials, and a sandbox allowing code play.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) Code questions and aggregated answers.
- [MarkDown Reference](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - Write Markdown like a pro. <p>&nbsp;</p>


### Text Editors 

Setting up **Brackets** for Mac/Windows and **CodePad** for Chromebooks. (I've used Atom, VSCode, NotePad++, among others...I prefer a free and open-source code editor with a strong development community, support for HTML/CSS, and attention to highly usable installers.) 

#### (Mac / Windows)

1. Download "**Brackets**" from [Brackets.io](https://www.brackets.io)
1. Select **View>Themes...**. Customize accessibility.
1. Select **View>Word Wrap**. Force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.
1. To Preview HTML in a web browser, save work, and select "lightning button" on upper-right side. Or open/refresh index.html file. 

#### (Chromebook)

1. Download "**Code Pad Text Editor**" from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB). 
1. From the dropdown menu, select **Editor>IDE Preferences**
1. Toggle "**Word wrap limit**" to the middle value (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)


#### (Browser-based Editors)

1. [Phoenix Web Editor](https://phcode.dev/) - Browser-based editor with built-in HTML preview.
2. GitHub.dev Web Editor - work with code within GitHub repository.

## Best Practices for Working with Code in the Classroom


* *Work with Code* – most all of the code your students will need to write has already been written. Encourage students to work with code, not write it. (Disagree? See our final entry)

* Admit ignorance – your students will be much more responsive to learning about code and computer science when they realize that their teachers are also learners.

* Be flexible – there are many solutions to any given problem. Use difference as an opportunity to engage learning, asking questions, and assessing quality in different circumstances.

* Don’t fix things for your students – teach students to learn how to learn by directing them to the right resources.

* Promote online learning spaces – most of the questions and answers we seek have already been discussed somewhere on the internet. Encourage students to discover and contribute to these spaces on sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow, and to use other learning spaces like W3.

* Leverage classroom knowledge – acknowledging your own limitations will encourage students who may possess more knowledge than you to speak up and take leadership roles.

* Set Deadlines, but be flexible – give your students all the time they need to figure out how to work with code. Demand excellence, but ensure learning.

* Think Small Groups – small groups provide a great way to help students learn to connect with the other through code.

* Offer Debugging Sessions – students will often arrive to class with big problems that require simple solutions. Allow students time to meet in small groups to solve their coding problems.

* Utilize Small Group Presentations - presenting work in small groups takes the pressure off of presenting in larger ones. They also allow students to ask more questions and learn more about their own learning.

* Group Share - After small group presentations, require each group to share-out the highlights of their experience, not only sharing what they made, but what they learned.

* Build Confidence – Be proud of your students! Encourage them to continue working with code and learning new technologies.

* Teach to Transfer - Offer plenty of time for students to assess what they learned and to process how they learned it. Focus on aspects of rhetoric, writing, and computational thinking that will transfer into other applications.

* Promote Other Kinds of Coding Experience – It may be unrealistic to learn more than Pitt Fuego in your classroom, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t encourage students to transfer their new knowledge and skills to learn more about code, even learning how to write their own.



SAMPLE TEACHING CYCLE (3 projects)

* **Code Icebreaker** - Start your class with code. Combine the standard classroom introduction with code education. Students will present who they are, where they came from, what they do, and where they want to go. (see: [Electrate Fuego](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/Electrate-Fuego) or [I AM...a Project in Becoming.](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/I-am-a-project-in-becoming))

* **Stasis Theory Generator** - Students use code to work through the four questions of stasis: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. (see: [Stasis Theory Machine](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/stasis-theory-machine), [Elevator Pitch Generator](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/elevator-pitch-generator))

* **Multimodal Communication Document** - Students use [Open Fuego Webtext Generator](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/open-fuego-webtext-generator) to make a mobile-ready multimodal communication document.
